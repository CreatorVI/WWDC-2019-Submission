 # Fight The Mosquitos
 **First** , try finding the mosquito by following the sound (Unfortunately, just like in real life, you can't easily find a mosquito simply by identifying the sound source. Thus I made the mosquitos red so you can easily spot them :)
 
 **After you have spotted it** , move your iPad (move quickly if you choose intelligent mosquito mode) towards the mosquito (imagine that your iPad is an electronic mosquito swatter) to kill it.
 
 Cool! Isn't it?
 
 ## After that
 Now, upgrade your "weapon." You can choose to use the laser gun.
 
 You can also choose the number of mosquitos in your room.
 
 ## Recommendation
 
 ‚óè Do try intelligence mode with swatter üòé
 
 
 ## Help
 
 **If you can't find the mosquito:**
 
 Be patient, look around and it must be somewhere around you.
 
 **If you can't kill the mosquito:**
 
 1. using mosquito swatter: You have to really speed your device up (in intelligent mode) just like you do before killing a mosquito with an electronic mosquito swatter and you have to collide with it.
 
 #### Wrong Way (Too Slow)
 
 ![Wrong Way (Too Slow)](wrongWay.mov "Wrong Way (Too Slow)")
 
 #### Right Way (Faaast!)
 
 ![Right Way (Faaast!)](rightWay.mov "Right Way (Faaast!)")
 
 2. using laser gun: the laser is very thin so you have to be a professional shooter (which takes practice)
 
 **If the game becomes suddenly over (very rare):**
 
 You are lucky that the mosquito flied directly to your electronic mosquito swatter and died üòÇ
